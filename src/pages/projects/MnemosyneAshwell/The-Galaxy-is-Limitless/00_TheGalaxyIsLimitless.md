## Pitch

When a reluctant necromancer who wants nothing more than to be alone & a budding politician who is bent on saving the world trip over each other in an airport & touch hands for a brief second neither of them thinks much of it. Meeting your soulmate is supposed to be a joyous event but what do you do when you don't remember meeting them? Now they have to find each other in a big city while dealing with magical and political mishaps.
