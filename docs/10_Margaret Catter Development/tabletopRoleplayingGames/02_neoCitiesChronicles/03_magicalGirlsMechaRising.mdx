## About the Game
In Magical Girl Mech Rising, each player creates a character who will become a magical Key Keeper that commands a mecha robot to defend their home from monsters. As players go about their day they flip over random cards they can trigger an event or stumble across a monster that needs defeating changing the course of the game. While flipping over cards you can also come across resources that you use to upgrade your mecha suit.
