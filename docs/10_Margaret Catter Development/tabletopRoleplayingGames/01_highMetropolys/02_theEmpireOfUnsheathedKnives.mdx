## About the Game
You are in a crew of mid-level freelance problem solvers doing your best to build a life better for your progeny. 

Kindness isn't a weakness, and some people do the right thing just because that is what is right, whether it is easy or hard to do. Their morals are not influenced by external expectations.
When the idea of revolution reaches you, which side will you stand on?
> Now with 80% more bounty hunting. Oh, shit, we made a socialist utopia and now it's time to join with the nearby country, thus turning our monarchy into a vanity project? Oh, and of course, I'll escort our esteemed lady the royal highness princess Blythe on her journey to her upcoming wedding.

Science Fantasy Space Opera

- Hopepunk explores resistance, rebellion, and resilience as counters to apathy and cynicism. It tells the narrative of hope and positive resistance in spite of challenges as a counter to pessimism.
- Noblebright is the premise that rejects a seemingly gritty and bleak view of the world setting that is considered amoral, violent and dystopian as might is right as the inevitable conclusion but instead looks within and takes the position that there are not only still good fights worth having but that they are also winnable with the conclusion instead being that of a happier ending.
