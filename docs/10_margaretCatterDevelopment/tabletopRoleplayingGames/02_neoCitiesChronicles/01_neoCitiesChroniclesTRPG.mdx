## About the Game
In the fantasy world of Neo Cities Chronicles, it is much like our own until the event known as The Opening of the Door. When this happened The-Once-From-Before began coming into the world and trying to colonize it for themselves and morph it into a place they they could live regardless of the people and things that already existed in the space. 

Key Keepers have been given the ability to stem the flow and send The-Once-From-Before back through The Doors and protect their homeworld. 

Neo Cities Chronicles and its shared universe is a political fantasy war game series. With its hex based grid combat and managing interdepartmental politics this game takes heavy influence from giant robot series politics and magical girls series dynamic relationships. 

Its target demographic is that of the shoujo or josei variety. As such this is a reference to the general demographic of players rather than a game style.
