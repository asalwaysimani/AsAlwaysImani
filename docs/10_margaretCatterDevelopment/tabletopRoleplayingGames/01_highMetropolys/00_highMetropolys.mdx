### Metagenres
High Urban Fantasy, is a genre mashup of High Fantasy and Urban Fantasy. 

High Urban Fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy leaning on classic fantasy & supernatural elements from the High Fantasy genre with the modern conveniences and understanding of the Urban Fantasy genre.

It takes the epic fantasy set in an alternative universe, including various magical and supernatural elements, and traditionally fantasy beings from High Fantasy and mashes it with Urban Fantasy's "normal" world and underlying understanding of the how and why said magical and supernatural elements exist giving a combination that leans more heavily on classic fantasy & supernatural tropes but still within a modern universe. 

Set in a modern alternative world that includes all of the prevalent modern technology of the “real” world in spite of the fact that it includes elements of magic and the supernatural.
