Doing all the things all over the internet. In a long term emotional relationship with Pop Punk. She's creating visual novels, tabletop roleplay games as well as roleplay focused board games, documentary projects and sometimes streaming on Twitch. A constantly screaming ball of rage about politics, anxiety, and depression. Making videos about various game development & design projects, all my multidisciplinary creative writing works, and also hosting live lets plays of solo tabletop board game.
